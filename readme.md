# Personal Neovim Configuration

The repository one is currently looking at is my personal configuration for Neovim.
Since I prefer simplicity, the editor has remained mainly unchanged compared to the base.
This page provides an overview of changes.

## Settings

- Relative line numbers
- Expanding tabs of length 4
- Smart indentation
- No text wrapping
